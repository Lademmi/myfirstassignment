    I made a promise to go back to tech this year but don't know how and when, fortunately, kiki posted about tech scholarship
    in collaboration with ALTSCHOOL, i applied and got picked.That was one of my happiest moments this year, going back to 
    what i love doing after focusing on Handcrafting jewelries for 2 years.
